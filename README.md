# UDP_Socket
Simple UDP Socket API, will soon support NAT Punchthrough and basic congestion control. Currently supports packet segmentation, packet reordering, and responding with ACKS.
It is also capable of sending out multiples of the same packet (redundant data) to help packet delivery over UDP.
